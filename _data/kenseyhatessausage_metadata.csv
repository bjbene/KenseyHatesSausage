khs010,sgt_stubby.jpg,,"Sgt. Stubby, decorated mascot of the 102nd Infantry, 26th Yankee Division",image/jpeg,"Found as a puppy by Private J. Robert Conroy in 1917, Stubby became the mascot of the 102nd Infantry, 26th Yankee Division. He learned the bugle calls, the drills, and even a modified salute (he put his right paw to his eyebrow). Stubby's positive effect on morale allowed him to remain in the camp, even though animals were forbidden. The division shipped out for France aboard the SS Minnesota. Private Conroy smuggled Stubby aboard, and when the Yankee Division headed for the front lines in February of 1918, Stubby accompanied the men as their mascot. He became accustomed to the loud rifles and heavy artillery fire. An injury from gas exposure left him sensitive to traces of gas. When the division was attacked in an early morning gas launch, Stubby recognized the gas and roused soldiers, saving many from harm. Stubby even caught a German soldier mapping out the layout of the Allied trenches. Stubby bit him on the legs, causing the soldier to trip and fall. He continued to attack until U.S. soldiers arrived. For capturing a spy, Stubby was promoted to the rank of sergeant becoming the first dog to be given rank in the United States Armed Forces. Later, Stubby was injured during a grenade attack. He was transferred to a Red Cross recovery hospital for surgery, and when well enough to move around, he visited wounded soldiers. Stubby served in seventeen battles. He visited the White House meeting Presidents Harding and Coolidge. He was awarded medals for heroism, and after the war, became the mascot of the Georgetown Hoyas. He died in 1926.
